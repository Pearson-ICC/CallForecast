a very broken and janky call forecasting solution just for fun

imports data from [CxHistoricalDataGrabber](https://github.com/ntflix/CxHistoricalDataGrabber) and then does some math to try and predict the number of calls that will be made in the

the data is totally wrong. please do not attempt to use this to actually forecast calls.
most of the program works. just the graph bit and the prediction bit are broken. never done data science before so i have no idea what i'm doing :-)
